I am a first-year Masterâ€™s student in the [Interdisciplinary Program in Artificial Intelligence ðŸ§  at Seoul National University](https://gsai.snu.ac.kr/), advised by [Prof. Bohyung Han](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/~bhhan/).

Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering âš¡ at SNU](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en), where I also conducted research at [CVLab](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/) on video generation using diffusion models. I co-authored a paper accepted to NeurIPS 2024 and worked with the SK Telecom Media Gen AI team ðŸŽ¬ through their AI Fellowship, focusing on text-based video generation.

My research interests include autoregressive diffusion models, memory-augmented video generation, and vision-language models ðŸ¤–.

Iâ€™m driven to create AI that can see, remember, and imagine â€” pushing the boundaries of intelligent media.
